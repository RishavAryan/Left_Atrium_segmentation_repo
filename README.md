# Left_Atrium_segmentation
Segmentation of the left atrium is a crucial task in cardiology to identify potential blockages that may lead to heart attacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proven to be valuable in this domain, with various models employed for segmentation, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and hybridized methods combining CNN and LSTM.

Despite the popularity of hybridized models, your analysis revealed that the dice score, commonly used for evaluation, did not perform well in the range of 0.85 to 0.92. In response to this, we developed a U-Net model for left atrium segmentation, modifying parameters to enhance its performance.it was observed that this model achieved a dice score of 0.94, which was found comparatively more accurate than any other hybridized model.
